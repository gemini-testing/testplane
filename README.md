Testplane (ex-Hermione) is a battle-hardened framework for testing web apps at any scale, any browser and any platform.

🧑‍💻 **Developer Friendly:** Enjoy a hassle-free start with our installation wizard, TypeScript support, instant feedback via live test editing, advanced HTML-reporter, and smart features like auto-wait and retries.

📸 **Visual Testing Redefined:** Capture anything from specific details to whole pages, manage diffs with a streamlined UI, explore a variety of diff modes and let Testplane tackle flakiness.

🌐 **Test Across Environments:** Forget being tied to a couple of latest Chrome builds. Testplane goes beyond that, offering testing on real devices and broad automation protocol support, mirroring your users' actual environments.

📈 **Scale Effortlessly:** Run thousands of tests on a remote browser grid or benefit from ultra-fast local execution. Testplane offers sharding, parallel test execution, and isolated browser contexts.

⚡ **Infinite Extensibility:** Testplane offers a versatile plugin system with dozens of open-source plugins on GitHub, along with custom reporters, commands, and execution logic.

## Getting started

> Note: if you prefer manual installation, you can run `npm i -D testplane`. Check out [the Docs](docs/quick-start.md) for details.

1. Use the CLI wizard to set up testplane and generate basic configuration:

    ```shell
    npm init testplane@latest new-testplane-project
    ```

   You may add `-- --verbose` argument to launch a tool in *extra-questions* mode, to pick custom package manager or install extra plugins.

2. Open the newly generated file `testplane-tests/example.testplane.ts`. We’ll modify the test to ensure the description includes expected text:

    ```typescript
    describe("test", () => {
        it("example", async ({browser}) => {
            await browser.url("https://example.com/");

            const description = await browser.$("p");

            expect(description).toHaveTextContaining("for use in illustrative examples in documents");
        });
    });
    ```

3. Launch GUI:

    ```shell
    npx testplane gui
   ```

4. Try running the test and watch it pass. Now, let's replace description text check with a visual assertion. Use the `assertView` command to carry out visual checks:

    ```diff
    - expect(description).toHaveTextContaining("for use in illustrative examples in documents");
    + await description.assertView("description"); // "description" is just a name of the assertion
      ```

5. Run the test again. It will fail, because a reference image for the heading is missing. You can accept the diff and re-run the test, it will then pass.

Congratulations on writing your first Testplane test, which navigates to a page and executes a visual assertion. Dive into the Docs to discover more awesome features Testplane has to offer!

## Rename from "Hermione"

This project was formerly known as "Hermione", but eventually some copyright and trademark issues surfaced, leading to the decision to rebrand. After some discussion, we settled on "Testplane" as the official new title. Considering this change as merely a rebranding, we've proceeded with the existing version count instead of starting anew. Thus, Testplane `v8.x` is a drop-in replacement for Hermione `v8.x`.
